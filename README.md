# memory-for-error-alpha

## Project Goal
This project seeks to determine whether socially anxious individuals show a memory-bias for errors, and to what extent this bias is driven by error monitoring.


## Background & Design
Social anxiety (SA), as one of the most pervasive and long-lasting anxiety disorders [1](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15939837/), is associated with an abnormal enhancement of error monitoring [2](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18271855/). Current theoretical models suggest that enhanced error monitoring is a downstream symptom of SA [3](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2013.00466/full), [4](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2013.00636/full). However, I suggest a novel reconceptualization of the role of error monitoring in SA: error monitoring plays a causal role in the maintenance of SA by orienting an individual's attention towards their errors. This serves to enhance the encoding of and subsequent memory for mistakes, especially within social settings, which, in turn, causes these individuals to exhibit a memory bias for errors. The memory bias ultimately leads to lower self-evaluations of oneâ€™s abilities in social settings. As this cascade of neurocognitive processes repeats across social situations over time, SA is maintained/worsened. To test this hypothesis, I conduct ERP and time-frequency analyses on data collected under `memory-for-error-dataset`. I aim to determine whether socially anxious individuals exhibit a memory-bias for errors, whether this bias is more prevalent in social settings, and to what degree it is driven by error monitoring.
